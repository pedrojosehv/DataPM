Junior Product Designer,Bending Spoons,Spain,"About the job At Bending Spoons, we’re striving to build one of the all-time great companies. A company that serves a huge number of customers. A company where team members grow to their full potential. A company that functions at unparalleled levels of effectiveness and efficiency. A company that creates value for shareowners at an extraordinary rate. And a company that does so while adhering to high ethical standards. To achieve this objective, we execute the following strategy: We acquire a digital business with untapped potential and make it as successful as we can by leveraging our platform—which comprises our expertise, technologies, data, brand, talents, and company culture. Then, we invest the proceeds into making our platform more powerful, and into acquiring new businesses. Thus, our strategy sees us combine an investor’s attention to capital allocation with the hands-on approach of an operator. For a talented, driven, and collaborative individual, working at Bending Spoons is an opportunity to learn, make an impact, and progress their career at an exceptionally high rate. That’s our promise to such a candidate. A few examples of your responsibilities Help shape outstanding user experiences and impact the success of our products by creating flawless UI and UX designs, from conceptualization to delivery. You’ll take a human-first approach to designing products, ensuring they delight users by being as effective as they are aesthetically pleasing. Make use of prototyping tools to ensure your designs are intuitive and to explore new, innovative ways of designing interactions. Work closely with product managers and software engineers to propose new features and improve the quality of both mobile and desktop apps. Focus on user testing and research to ensure our customers are always at the core of our product designs. Find, together with engineers, the most efficient trade-off between high-value solutions for users and the complexity of implementation. Leverage usage data to evaluate the impact of your designs, and apply your learnings to the next iterations. What we look for Reasoning ability. Given the necessary knowledge, you can solve complex problems. You think from first principles, and structure your ideas sharply. You resist the influence of biases. You identify and take care of the details that matter. Drive. You’re extremely ambitious in everything you do—and your initiative, effort, and tenacity match the intensity of your ambition. You feel deeply responsible for your work. You hold yourself to a high—and rising—bar. Team spirit. You give generously and without the expectation of receiving in return. You support the best idea, not your idea. You're always happy to get your hands dirty to help your team. You’re reliable, honest, and transparent. Proficiency in English. You read, write, and speak proficiently in English. What we offer Incredibly talented, entrepreneurial teams. You’ll work in small, result-oriented, autonomous teams alongside some of the brightest people in your field. An exceptional opportunity for growth. We go to great lengths to hire individuals of outstanding potential—then, our priority is to put them in the ideal position to thrive. Spooners in their 20s lead products worth hundreds of millions of dollars. And if you’ve got what it takes, you’ll soon be playing an essential role in major projects, too. Competitive pay and access to equity in the company. Typically, we offer an individual at the start of their career a salary of £54,545 in the UK and €52,246 elsewhere. If they possess a few years of relevant experience, the salary on offer tends to be between £66,779 and £149,636 in the UK, and €63,965 and €143,330 elsewhere. Pay grows rapidly as you accumulate experience and translate it into greater impact. You can also receive some of your pay in company equity at a discounted price, thus participating in the value creation we achieve together. If relocating to Italy, you may enjoy a 50% tax cut. All. These. Benefits. Flexible hours, remote working, unlimited backing for learning and training, top-of-the-market health insurance, a rich relocation package, generous parental support, and a yearly retreat to a stunning location. We help each Spooner set up the conditions to do their best work. Commitment & contract Permanent or fixed-term. Full-time. Location Milan (Italy), London (UK) or remote. Before you apply Bending Spoons is a demanding environment: We’re extremely ambitious and we hold ourselves—and one another—to a high standard. While this tends to lead to extraordinary learning, achievement, and career growth, it also requires significant commitment. To help you ramp up quickly and set yourself up for success, we recommend spending your first few months working from our Milan office, regardless of your long-term work location. It’s the best way to rapidly absorb our company culture and build trust with your new teammates. We’ll support you with generous travel and accommodation assistance. After that, you’re welcome to work from our offices in Milan or London, or remotely from approved countries—depending on what we agree at the offer stage. If the role speaks to you and you’re excited to give your best, we’d love to hear from you. Apply now—we can’t wait to meet you. The selection process If you pass our screening, we’ll ask you to take on a few tests that assess how you approach unfamiliar problems. If you’re successful with those, we’ll invite you to a series of interviews. Bending Spoons is an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer. We consider for employment any applicant and we provide reasonable accommodations for an applicant with disabilities, which can be requested through this form. Studies suggest that women tend not to apply for a job if their CV isn’t a perfect fit. Here, talent takes precedence over experience. So if you like the role and think you could be awesome at it in time, go ahead and apply.

What we’re building at Xata: We're building a database platform for companies that rely on PostgreSQL at scale. And by “at scale,” we don’t just mean large volumes of data or high server counts, we also mean growing teams and the operational complexity that comes with them: staging and developer branches with data, data anonymization and privacy, zero-downtime schema changes, and more. In every feature we build, we optimise for developer experience, high performance, and flexibility. This gives our customers the confidence to rely on us for one of the most critical pieces of their cloud infrastructure. The AI wave of developer tools presents exciting opportunities and challenges - and PostgreSQL and Xata are well-positioned to be at the center of it.

Be part of a healthy culture, one that genuinely supports innovation, empowers individuals, and cares deeply about its people. We work asynchronously. We don’t do agile.

As a product designer on the team, you’ll work at the intersection of design and engineering, driving both decisions that directly impact the design and code quality of Stripe products. You’ll be asked to collaborate with designers and product teams from across the company to design systems, components, and tools that raise the quality and consistency of Stripe product experiences. Responsibilities Design reusable components and patterns that align with Stripe’s design principles. Prototype components and reusable end-to-end experiences, contribute to design system repositories, and support engineering efforts. Create and maintain clear, comprehensive documentation to enable teams across the organization to adopt and extend the design system effectively. Create and maintain shared UI libraries, patterns, and templates in Figma. Facilitate training sessions to educate and onboard teams using the design system. Advocate for accessibility in all aspects of the design system. Who you are We’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement. Minimum Requirements 4+ years relevant design experience at a product-driven tech company. Strong skills in visual design, interaction design, and prototyping demonstrated through a portfolio of work, spanning desktop and mobile surfaces.

While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office.

This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and specific location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the primary location may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Product Designer,n8n,European Union,"About the job Note: Good Maven is managing this hiring process on behalf of n8n. Please direct any questions about the role or application process to the Good Maven team. We're happy to help! n8n started off as a workflow automation tool, but has increasingly become a tool for plugging AI into your business. In fact, n8n is a great platform for blending the three fundamental building blocks of automation: AI, code-based steps, and people-based ones. With the kind of traction only AI can bring (look us up on Google Trends), we now have the opportunity to become the visual tool for integrating AI into businesses — and shaping how that looks, feels, and works will be your design challenge at n8n. Nothing is off the table! We were founded end of 2019 and currently: 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 We’re a diverse team of + 140 talented people 🚀 Our annual recurring revenue is growing over 8x year-over-year ⭐️ With +117k GitHub stars, we are in the top 100 most popular projects of all time on Github 🍾 We were the 25th fastest growing startup last year and 4th BtoB SaaS Rising 100 this year in Europe according to Sifted 🌱 We were Sequoia's first seed investment in Germany, and most recently secured our $60M Series B (February '25, led by Highland) This is a huge opportunity that requires wrestling with some questions that don’t yet have widely-accepted answers. For example: How can the power of AI be put in the hands of non-developers? What is the best UX for getting an AI model to automate a business process? How can we give users trust that an AI-generated process will be reliable? How do we make the output of an AI model easily understandable? What you will be doing: 🧭 Design AI features that solve real problems for our users Whether it’s building a UI for prompt-based agents, improving the experience building AI apps with n8n, or designing how users evaluate AI output, you’ll make sure that designs are intuitive, effective & efficient. 🧠 Explore the space, not just the screens This isn’t a paint-by-numbers role. We’re still figuring out what great AI features look like inside n8n. You’ll work closely with product, engineering, and users to run experiments, prototype quickly, and test ideas before they become big bets. 🤝 Collaborate with a small, senior team You’ll join an existing team of talented designers and work closely with engineers and PMs who care deeply about quality, craft, and user experience. This role is an opportunity to both learn and lead: sharing feedback, elevating the design practice, and helping shape the direction of our product. You’ll bring strong design thinking and a user-centered mindset to the table, helping us raise the bar together. 🎯 Focus on real impact You’ll design for users who are actually building with AI. Our users are developers, operations folks, and automation-minded problem-solvers.. REQUIREMENTS 👁️ You have high design craft and taste You obsess over clean interactions, flows, and structure, but also know when to move fast. You’ve developed or contributed to design systems, and can elevate the visual and UX polish of a product. 🧩 You love solving messy, ambiguous problems You thrive in greenfield areas where the path isn’t obvious. You know how to explore ideas quickly, validate with users, and turn early signals into sharp design decisions. 💻 You’re technically fluent — and can code You’re comfortable reading and writing code (HTML, CSS, JS) and understand how the systems you’re designing actually get built. You don’t need to own engineering work, but you speak the language and know how to move between design and implementation seamlessly. You enjoy experimenting with new ways of working, with AI-assisted approaches or vibe-coding. 🤖 Genuine interest in AI You don’t need to be an expert, but you’re curious and proactive, experimenting with AI tools, learning as you go, and staying informed about what’s possible. 🚢 End-to-End Product Design Experience You have many years of experience designing and shipping meaningful product features in real-world settings (and failed along the way) across the full lifecycle. 👂 You’re user-obsessed and insight-driven You know how to run generative research, prototype ideas, test them, and fold insights back into your work. You’re constantly learning from users, data, and the broader ecosystem. Benefits Competitive compensation 💸 – We offer fair and attractive pay. Ownership 💪 – Our core value is to “empower others,” and we mean it—you’ll get a slice of n8n with equity.

"Product Manager - Website Experience (US/Europe, Remote)",WebPros,"Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain","About the job Location: Remote, US/Europe | Full-time About WebPros WebPros is committed to empowering businesses worldwide through cutting-edge solutions in web hosting, billing automation, infrastructure, server management, and online marketing. Since our founding in 2017, we’ve rapidly grown into a global leader, expanding our robust portfolio to include industry-defining brands such as cPanel & WHM, Plesk, WHMCS, SolusVM, NIXStats, XOVI, SocialBee, and Sitejet. Today, we power 85 million+ websites across 900,000+ servers worldwide, backed by a 600+ strong team of dedicated professionals spanning multiple continents. At WebPros, we embrace a fully remote, borderless workplace with a focus on flexibility, autonomy, and work-life balance. Whether you prefer working from a bustling city hub or a quiet home office, we enable our teams to thrive from anywhere while staying deeply connected through our strong collaborative culture. Your Role Hi, I’m Hendrik, Director of Product Management (Website Experience) here at WebPros—and your future manager. I’ve built my career at the intersection of product management, marketing, and sales, co-founding ventures that were later acquired by hosting industry leaders. With a degree in Business Information Systems, I thrive in strategic roles and love driving innovation. My “do-it-for-me” web design business transformed into Sitejet, which is now fully integrated into both cPanel and Plesk—empowering web professionals around the world to build better websites. I’m deeply committed to excellence and the continuous evolution of our products. In my role, I oversee the entire Website Experience division, including the Sitejet website builder, Site Quality Monitoring, and all other website tools in cPanel & Plesk. I look forward to working together to push our product suite to new heights. We’re now hiring a Product Manager to leverage Plesk and cPanel as strategic platforms to drive the adoption of our solutions and boost revenue growth. Our core mission is to provide a suite of robust tools and functionalities that cater to a diverse audience, enabling everyone—from beginners to seasoned developers—to seamlessly build and manage websites and web applications. You’ll be working across both ecosystems, aligning with internal stakeholders and external platform teams to shape high-impact solutions. The biggest challenge in this role? Navigating the technical depth of cPanel and Plesk while coordinating with platform teams you don’t directly manage. You’ll need to align roadmaps, manage dependencies, and work through adoption resistance from partners. With development resources still being clarified, you’ll need to operate with agility, creativity, and a clear sense of strategic priorities. You’ll be expected to lead discovery, validate solutions with partners, and build compelling use cases that make integration a no-brainer. You’ll thrive here if you’re comfortable working across technical boundaries, influencing without authority, and engaging deeply with hosting providers. If you enjoy solving go-to-market challenges, documenting real customer workflows, and translating partner needs into product wins—this is your space. You might struggle here if you don’t have practical experience with cPanel or Plesk. You’re uncomfortable working without direct control over development teams. You lack experience partnering with hosting providers or navigating adoption barriers. You prefer highly structured environments with clearly defined resources from the start. This is a critical role for someone who understands the web hosting ecosystem and is ready to lead with focus, creativity, and resilience. You’ll bridge the gap between product vision and platform reality—ensuring our tools integrate smoothly into complex hosting environments. This is a hands-on, high-impact role where your ability to align with partners, navigate technical platforms, and drive adoption will directly influence our revenue and market position. If you’re excited to work at the intersection of product development, platform partnerships, and user experience, we’d love to hear from you. Below, you’ll find everything you need to decide if this role is right for you—from our team culture and working rhythms to the detailed responsibilities, qualifications, and interview process. We believe in transparency and want you to have a clear, inside look at what it’s like to shape the future of website experience at WebPros. Your Impact In The First 180 Days We don’t believe in endless checklists of requirements. Instead, here’s what success looks like in your first 6 months: 30 Days Get up to speed on cPanel and Plesk platforms, including their technical architecture and key features Meet with internal teams and external cPanel/Plesk partners to understand current collaboration processes Review existing product offerings, adoption metrics, and partner feedback Identify immediate gaps in partner engagement and integration readiness Begin building relationships with key stakeholders across engineering, sales, and partner teams 60 Days Develop a detailed plan to address partner adoption challenges and streamline user onboarding processes Collaborate with UX design and engineering to start defining priority features and improvements Conduct customer and partner interviews to gather deeper insights on pain points and opportunities Establish communication and alignment routines with cPanel and Plesk platform teams Begin drafting product roadmaps that reflect realistic timelines and resource availability 90 Days Launch initial product enhancements or pilot programs aimed at increasing partner adoption Implement user testing sessions and iterate on solutions based on feedback Work closely with Sales and Partner Enablement to support go-to-market efforts Monitor progress against roadmap milestones and adjust plans as needed Identify and escalate any resource or dependency risks impacting delivery 180 Days Demonstrate measurable improvements in partner adoption and integration success Scale successful pilots and roll out expanded features to broader hosting provider audiences Refine long-term product vision in collaboration with platform partners and internal stakeholders Optimize cross-functional processes for ongoing collaboration and feedback gathering Establish yourself as the go-to expert for cPanel and Plesk product strategy within the organization This roadmap lays out the critical milestones and focus areas that will set you up for success. By the end of your first six months, you’ll have established yourself as a key driver of product adoption and partner success across the cPanel and Plesk platforms. You’ll be leading strategic initiatives with clear roadmaps, fostering strong cross-organizational relationships, and continuously improving how our solutions deliver value to hosting providers and end users. You’ll Thrive Here If You Have strong hands-on experience with cPanel and Plesk and understand their ecosystems deeply Are confident working cross-functionally with internal teams and external platform partners Enjoy solving adoption challenges by creating clear value propositions and enabling partners effectively Can translate technical customer feedback into actionable product improvements Are comfortable operating with agility in ambiguous environments and managing dependencies without direct control You Might Struggle Here If You Prefer working on a single product or within a narrowly defined scope without external collaboration Need detailed, top-down instructions for daily tasks or find it hard to prioritize without clear guidelines Avoid collaborating across engineering, sales, and external partners to solve complex challenges Expect full control over all resources and dependencies Lack practical experience with cPanel or Plesk or struggle to influence third-party teams without direct authority How We Work Team & Workflow: You’ll partner closely with cross-functional teams including design, engineering, sales, and key stakeholders to brainstorm, refine, and align on product ideas and initiatives. Own the full product management workflow—from customer and market research (analyzing feedback, conducting interviews, monitoring trends) to prioritizing features and managing resources, ensuring everything stays aligned with the overall product vision and business goals. Collaboration & Ownership: Operate in a remote-friendly, asynchronous communication environment using Slack and Confluence. Participate in regular cross-team syncs (alignment meetings) to maintain transparency and adapt plans responsively to shifting priorities and resource constraints. You’ll also lead user-centric design and testing efforts, creating customer journey maps and conducting user testing sessions to validate concepts and identify pain points. Tech Stack & Tools: Leverage a suite of collaboration, planning, and analytics tools including Confluence, Jira, Trello, Figma, Miro, Mixpanel, Slack, and Microsoft Office (Word, PowerPoint, Excel) to facilitate effective communication, documentation, and data-driven decision-making. The specific tech stack may vary depending on the product stream and team you’re working with, allowing flexibility to use the most appropriate tools for each context. Cloud & Infrastructure: Our infrastructure leverages scalable cloud platforms combined with managed services to support high availability and secure operations. Dedicated DevOps and engineering teams handle infrastructure management, monitoring, and optimization. As a Product Manager, you stay closely aligned with these teams to understand infrastructure dependencies and constraints that impact product planning and delivery. Testing & Quality: User-centric design and testing are embedded in the product lifecycle. You’ll lead initiatives involving customer journey mapping and user testing sessions to validate product concepts and uncover pain points, ensuring solutions meet user needs before full release. Releases & CI/CD: We employ a hybrid release model, balancing scheduled weekly or monthly releases with continuous deployment for rapid iteration. Engineering teams own the CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, deployment processes, rollbacks, and hotfixes. Product Managers coordinate release schedules and communicate timelines to stakeholders, ensuring smooth delivery and alignment with business priorities. Our Culture WebPros is built on diversity, not just in principle but by design. We’ve grown through acquiring industry-leading brands, bringing together teams from 42+ nationalities, 20+ countries, and 10+ brands. Instead of enforcing a one-size-fits-all culture, we embrace unique perspectives, different working styles, and localized expertise to drive global innovation.

Product Support Specialist - EMEA,Ashby,European Union,"About the job 👋 Hello! I’m Laura, Support Manager at Ashby. I'm excited to share that we're hiring a Product Support Specialist in EMEA 🎉. Please note: at this time, we are seeking Product Support Specialists to cover weekend shifts, as a tradeoff for a weekday. Our available shifts cover a Sunday through Thursday schedule, or a Tuesday through Saturday schedule. Occasional schedule changes may be required to accommodate holidays, coverage gaps, or business demands. You may let us know your preferred working hours in the application. Over the past few years, we’ve built a team of Ashby experts who delight our customers with their keen attention to detail, deep product knowledge, and fast service. In joining us, you’d bring that same level of world-class support to our customers based in Europe and Asia. In this role, you will spend a lot of time working directly with customers. Ashby’s product encompasses a wide breadth, and is quite complex. In this role, you can expect to work on tickets requiring complex integration troubleshooting, to providing customers with detailed workflow instructions. You’ll Also Spend Time On Projects That Make The Work That We Do Better. Past Projects Our Team Has Taken On Include Absorbing and synthesizing highly technical work from our Engineering Team to create enablement for technical up-leveling of the broader Support Team Developing workflow automation allowing for better team cohesion and efficacy As a company, we value a strong sense of ownership, principled thinking over experience, and thoughtful communication. These and other values we’ll discuss in more detail during the interview process inform how we do the work. You Should Apply If You have experience with and are excited to learn the ins and outs of a complex and rapidly evolving product You’re curious—both in addressing customers and creating solutions that improve our workflows. You seek the answers beyond what’s on the surface. You have strong problem-solving skills. You’re skilled at both defining the scope of a problem and creating a comprehensive solution. You delight customers. You possess keen attention to detail, ensure your responses are thorough and clear, and are empathetic along the way. You prioritize ownership in finding solutions for customers. When given a problem, you proactively make decisions rooted in principled thinking to solve it. You have offered B2B support to customers, ranging from Small Business through Enterprise organizations. You Should Not Apply If You avoid getting in the weeds of solving technical problems: each member of our support team is highly technical and capable of solving deeply complex tickets You prefer to triage tickets swiftly; if tagging in Engineering early on (without attempting comprehensive solutions) is an exhale moment, this is likely not a great fit You prefer to support a product you can know the ins and outs of quickly (such as a point solution) rather than a product that is rapidly evolving with quite a bit of surface area You value in office culture for motivation; this role is remote (given our office is in San Francisco) so we're seeking self-starters! About Ashby We’re building the next generation of enterprise software, and we’re starting with a suite of products that help talent leaders, recruiters, and hiring managers run their hiring process significantly better. Learn more on our website: https://www.ashbyhq.com/ We are well-funded and backed by great investors, including Y Combinator, Elad Gil and Lachy Groom. We publicly launched in October 2022 and are already work with amazing companies we're proud to partner with. We’ve built an incredible team and exceptional product over the past few years, and we truly are just getting started. In short, this is the perfect time to join 🚀 About Go To Market We view our Support team as an extension of the product itself, one that ensures an optimal customer experience for customers ranging across all market segments. Here are a few points that should give you an idea of what it is like to work with us: We spend a lot of time building best-in-class products since we believe a highly differentiated product is easier to sell. We also spend a lot of time building a best-in-class customer experience. We aim to offer deep expertise whenever we interact with prospects and customers. We strongly believe that small teams with very talented people and the right work environment deliver much better performance than teams with large headcount. Interview Process Role Our interview process is thorough — we aim to ensure each person that joins the team is the right fit for Ashby and will provide ample information for you to assess if Ashby is the right fit for you. The process for this role is as follows: Intro Call with Recruiting - 30 Minutes Take Home Assessment - 1 week to complete Hiring Manager Interview - 45-60 Minutes Virtual Onsite - 90 Minutes Onboarding Process Ashby is a highly complex product, and we invest a lot of time in ensuring our support team members are experts on the platform. Your first 30 days will primarily focus on learning the finer points of the products; you may not respond directly to a customer in that time but don’t worry, you’ll be plenty busy learning! Benefits 10-year exercise window for stock options. You shouldn’t feel pressure to purchase stock options if you leave Ashby —do it when you feel financially comfortable. Unlimited PTO with four weeks is recommended per year. Expect “Vacation?” in our one-on-one agenda until you start taking it 😅 Twelve weeks of fully paid family leave in the US. We plan to expand this to employees in other countries as situations arise. Generous equipment, software, and office furniture budget. Get what you need to be happy and productive! $100/month education budget with more expensive items (like conferences) covered with manager approval. Ashby provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities."

Sr. Product Manager Servicios Financieros (H/M),Northius,Spain,"About the job ¿Quieres liderar el diseño de productos que optimizan el corazón financiero de una EdTech en plena transformación? En Northius, el mayor grupo de formación online en España con +10 escuelas, +40.000 nuevos estudiantes cada año y presencia en más de 17 países, estamos revolucionando cómo miles de personas acceden a educación práctica y orientada a la empleabilidad. Nuestro compromiso es facilitar esa transformación vital que permite cambiar de carrera, crecer profesionalmente, y construir un futuro más estable. Para lograrlo, también debemos transformar desde dentro. Y ahí entras tú. Estamos buscando un/a Senior Product Manager que lidere la creación de productos potentes, útiles y transformadores para nuestras áreas Financieras, Administrativas y Legales. Una persona que combine visión de producto, capacidad analítica avanzada, profundo conocimiento financiero y pasión por resolver problemas complejos. Challenge Northius no es una empresa financiera, pero sin finanzas no hay impacto educativo. Queremos rediseñar desde cero los productos que dan soporte a nuestra operación financiera: desde la contabilidad hasta la gestión de cobros, desde las compras hasta los sistemas de recobro, pasando por la facturación, la tesorería y la gestión de contratos. Una parte clave del reto será diseñar e implementar herramientas inteligentes basadas en IA o potenciadas por IA, que nos permitan anticipar comportamientos de pago, optimizar la gestión de deuda, automatizar flujos operativos y tomar mejores decisiones. Esto implicará colaborar estrechamente con nuestros equipos de Applied AI y Product Science para crear productos donde la inteligencia artificial sea parte del diseño, no un añadido posterior. Tu reto será identificar oportunidades de mejora reales, mapear procesos actuales (a veces caóticos), proponer soluciones sostenibles, y liderar productos que permitan eficiencia, control y escalabilidad sin fricciones internas. Puede que no suene muy glamuroso. Pero no lo dudes: es vital porque es lo que nos permitirá crecer con orden y ofrecer mejores experiencias a nuestros alumnos, empleados y proveedores. ¿Qué buscamos? Estamos en la búsqueda de un/a Senior Product Manager que lidere con visión y pasión la transformación de la educación. Queremos a alguien que pueda tomar decisiones con la misma confianza que tiene para liderar experimentos; una persona capaz de decir: ""lo validamos con datos"". Alguien que no teme cometer errores porque sabe que de ellos se aprende, y solo aprendiendo podemos crecer para ayudar a nuestros alumnos. En suma, una persona que esté lista para ayudar a Northius a construir una experiencia educativa moderna y de alto impacto. ¿Qué harás? Liderarás el ciclo completo de productos asociados a finanzas y pagos: desde la ideación hasta la puesta en marcha y evolución posterior, validando siempre con datos y KPIs de negocio. Diseñarás soluciones centradas en procesos internos críticos: facturación, morosidad, recobro, pagos a proveedores, conciliaciones, fiscalidad, auditoría, etc. Colaborarás con equipos de Administración, Compras, Legal, Tesorería, Finanzas y Control de Gestión, convirtiéndote en su socio estratégico y agente de cambio. Trabajarás mano a mano con nuestros especialistas en Applied AI y Data Analytics, por lo que se espera de ti una sólida capacidad para definir, analizar y transformar métricas financieras complejas. Serás un referente en diseño de procesos, ayudando a modelar operaciones que pueden ser human-centric, AI-centric o human-AI augmented, y definiendo cuál es el enfoque más adecuado en cada caso. Participarás en la co-creación de la cultura de producto en un entorno en pleno crecimiento, donde el liderazgo de producto va mucho más allá de la gestión de tickets. ¿Qué necesitamos de ti? 5+ años de experiencia como Product Manager en entornos de alta complejidad financiera, idealmente en empresas B2B, SaaS, FinTech o similares. Conocimiento sólido de conceptos de contabilidad, conciliación bancaria, fiscalidad, deuda y gestión de cobros, así como sensibilidad por los temas legales y regulatorios. Background o familiaridad profunda con áreas como Recobro, Risk Management, Backoffice financiero o herramientas tipo ERP (como Business Central, SAP o similares). Alta capacidad analítica y comodidad trabajando con modelos financieros, cohortes de deuda, márgenes y rentabilidad operativa. Experiencia trabajando con equipos técnicos, legales y financieros, con capacidad para traducir sus necesidades en soluciones reales, no solo “requisitos”. Dominio real y aplicado de herramientas de Inteligencia Artificial generativa y analítica para mejorar tu productividad, toma de decisiones y capacidad de descubrimiento. En nuestro equipo, el uso avanzado de IA ya no es un diferencial: es el nuevo ofimático. Capacidad para navegar procesos cambiantes, identificar puntos de fricción y orquestar la evolución organizativa necesaria para escalar. ¿Qué te ofrecemos? Formar parte del equipo de Producto, Data & Tecnología (PED) de una empresa que está transformando el sector educativo. Posibilidad de trabajar 100% remoto desde cualquier parte de España o asistir a nuestras oficinas en Madrid, A Coruña ó Barcelona. Horario flexible para que puedas equilibrar tus responsabilidades personales y laborales. Jornada intensiva en verano, todos los viernes y las vísperas de festivos. Un plan de formación y desarrollo para que sigas creciendo profesionalmente. Una cultura que valora la colaboración, el uso de datos para tomar decisiones, y donde equivocarse es parte del proceso de aprendizaje. Acceso a beneficios como seguro médico, cheque gourmet, y descuentos en servicios de bienestar. En Northius creemos que la educación cambia vidas. Ayúdanos a seguir construyendo esos cimientos que permiten a las personas soñar y crecer. Si quieres unirte a una empresa que no solo educa, sino que transforma, ¡este es tu lugar! ¿Con quién vas a trabajar?

Senior Product Engineer,Wave Mobile Money,Spain,"About the job Our mission We're making Africa the first cashless continent. In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash. We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across six countries and are growing fast. Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in... How you'll help us achieve it Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users. And, we’re still in the early days of our product roadmap and potential impact on people’s everyday lives. As a Senior Engineer, you will be an integral part of one of our product teams. We are seeking an individual who excels in delivering high-quality individual contributor work, guided by comprehensive design docs, passion for UX, user feedback, and data analysis. In this role, you will be expected to elevate standards and exemplify best practices within your team. Strong communication skills and a proactive, driven mindset are crucial for success, as you will frequently collaborate with colleagues across various departments and roles to ensure project progression and overcome challenges. You'll join an autonomous, cross-functional team focused on a single area of Wave's product. Each team is led by a Product Manager and an Engineering Manager or Tech Lead. We organize projects to give you as much ownership as possible. Typically, you'll be responsible for a feature or improvement end-to-end, from design through deployment. Our to-do list changes constantly, but here are some recent projects: Enabling people to use their Wave app to pay for products in stores. Allowing people to pay their electricity bills with Wave by integrating with electrical utility companies. Building an app for business owners to pay their employees' salaries using Wave. Allowing people to pay for their transportation on taxis, trains & buses. In This Role You’ll Collaborate with Product to design and build features and tooling for both external and internal users. Investigate user feedback and resolve system bugs. Drive technical design discussions and direction. Actively pair with others and perform code reviews. Mentor engineers and foster their growth. Hold project debriefs and help us improve our project development cycle. Key Details This is a fully remote role. Candidates must be based in one of our talent hub countries (UK, Spain, USA, Canada, Kenya and Ghana) or in one of our operating markets in Africa including Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, or Burkina Faso. Wave provides a yearly $1,200 stipend to support coworking meetups with teammates. Remote team members are expected to travel to our operational markets (e.g. Senegal or Côte d'Ivoire) at least once a year. Exceptions apply, but we’ve found this key to understanding our users and product. We run performance reviews twice a year and award bonuses or promotions to strong performers who have been with the company for more than six months. Our salaries are competitive and are calculated using a transparent formula. For this role, depending on your level and location, we offer a salary of $167,000- $178,200 USD, plus a generous equity package. Major benefits: Subsidized health insurance for you and your dependents and retirement contributions (both vary from country to country). 6 months of fully paid parental leave and subsidized fertility assistance. Flexible vacation, with most folks taking between 21-30 days exclusive of statutory holidays. $10,000 annual charitable donation matching. Requirements Minimum of 5 years of professional experience as a software engineer. Fluent in English, bilingual in French is a big bonus. Successful candidates must be willing to travel to one of our operating locations at least once per year for a minimum of 6 consecutive days. You might be a good fit if you Reflexively ask yourself, “is this code the best way to make my users happy?” Want to learn to solve hard problems and aren’t afraid to ask for help when you get stuck. Are excited to learn about complex systems. Can communicate clearly with colleagues who work, speak and think differently. Work to make things easier for the next engineer who will touch your code. Always try to improve as a programmer and colleague. Are excited to deeply understand the inner workings of the tools you use. About engineering at Wave We care about the big picture. We don’t hire engineers to just ship tickets. We hire them to solve problems. That means caring deeply about outcomes, understanding context, and jumping in wherever something’s broken, even if it’s technically “not your area.” When we see problems, inefficiencies, or opportunities to make something better, we act. We dig into operational issues, clarify fuzzy product specs, or step into unfamiliar code to help unblock teammates. We move as fast as possible. Speed matters. It lets us try things quickly, get feedback early, and course-correct while it’s cheap. So we write small PRs. We aim for MVPs. We leave TODOs and file follow-ups. We don’t over-perfect v1. That said, we’re building a financial product. Some things—like money movement, correctness, or security—deserve more caution. We like boring technology. We favor tools that are reliable, well-understood, and easy to debug. This keeps us focused on solving meaningful problems instead of wrestling with unpredictable infrastructure. If a new technology helps us move faster, build safer, or solve a real need, we’ll consider it. But we don’t adopt tools just because they’re new—we adopt them because they’re right. Simplicity is a strategy. It lets us focus our energy where it matters most: serving our users. Our stack (prior experience is a strong plus, but not required): backend: Python 3 (+ mypy) API layer: GraphQL android frontend: Kotlin/Jetpack iOS frontend: Swift/SwiftUI web frontend: TypeScript/React database: Postgres infrastructure: GCP/Terraform orchestration: Kubernetes Our team We have a rapidly growing in-country team in Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire, Mali, Burkina Faso, The Gambia, and Uganda, plus remote team members spread across the world. We're deeply passionate about our mission of bringing radically affordable financial services to the people who need them most. We foster autonomy for our employees. You'll own your projects at every stage, from understanding the problem to monitoring your solution in production. We raised the largest Series A in Africa in 2021. Our world-class investors, include Founders Fund, Sequoia Heritage, Stripe, Ribbit Capital, Y Combinator, and Partech Africa. We are on Y Combinator's top companies by revenue .

This isn't just about managing a product; it's about achieving specific, measurable outcomes that directly impact students' lives. You'll be given a clear objective tied to real student success, and it's your mission to make it happen and validate it with data. Dive deeply into the educational challenges, transform your insights into structured ""Brain Lifts"" that enhance both human and AI intelligence, and drive rapid product iterations until the results speak for themselves. You'll be launching impactful features swiftly and refining them with agility. At LearnWith.AI, we're not just adding technology to an outdated system; we're creating a new paradigm. The traditional U.S. education model, built for the average student, is obsolete. Our platform leverages decades of learning science, expertise, and AI-driven coaching to provide personalized instruction on a grand scale. Whether it's aiding a student in recovering from learning setbacks or excelling in their AP exams, we're demonstrating that education can be both tailored and transformative. This role isn't for those who prefer to dwell in abstract strategies or get bogged down in minutiae. If you're waiting for someone to hand you a plan or if you favor defining features over defining success, this may not be the right fit. But if you're eager to tackle real-world challenges, fluent in data, and excited about using AI to enhance your thinking, you'll find your place here. You'll collaborate closely with a dedicated team of engineers, educators, and AI innovators, working directly with founders to make a significant impact on student outcomes.

Senior Product Manager,Spacelift,European Economic Area,"About the job Spacelift is an infrastructure orchestration platform that manages your entire infrastructure lifecycle — provisioning, configuration and governance. Spacelift integrates with all your infrastructure tooling (e.g. Terraform, OpenTofu, CloudFormation, Pulumi, Ansible) to provide a single integrated workflow so you can deliver secure, cost-effective, and resilient infrastructure, fast. By automating deployment and configuration, providing developer self-service, golden paths with guardrails, and an OPA policy engine, Spacelift empowers businesses to accelerate developer velocity while maintaining control and governance over their infrastructure. Spacelift offers unrivaled support, no-nonsense pricing, and a range of deployment models to fit your specific needs. Spacelift was founded in 2020 by long-time DevOps practitioner Marcin Wyszynski and successful entrepreneur Pawel Hytry and has raised $31.3M in funding over three rounds from top venture capital firms including Insight Partners, Blossom Capital, Hoxton Ventures, and Inovo Venture partners. The Role Spacelift is looking for a Senior Product Manager to own the core user experience of Infrastructure-as-Code delivery. Your focus: making Spacelift the best platform in the world for managing infrastructure with Terraform and OpenTofu. You’ll define product bets around runs, state, dependencies, drift detection, and the execution path that gets code into infrastructure. You’ll partner closely with our Foundations team—the builders of our stack engine—and with OpenTofu maintainers to shape how infrastructure practitioners work every day. This is a hands-on PM role for someone who’s deeply familiar with the sharp edges of Terraform-based workflows—and wants to eliminate them for good. What You’ll Do Make Spacelift the default choice for OpenTofu and Terraform practitioners. Identify pain in the current IaC delivery lifecycle—then reduce it with better primitives, defaults, and visibility. Drive product bets around state handling, run orchestration, policy enforcement, and config injection. Shape Spacelift’s support and alignment with OpenTofu (we’re a major sponsor). Ensure features like drift detection, stack dependencies, and run approvals serve real user goals—not theoretical flexibility. Serve as the internal voice of the IaC practitioner. You’ve been in their shoes. Balance extensibility and clarity. Power is only valuable if people can wield it safely. You’ll synthesize customer feedback, usage metrics, and industry trends to define a roadmap that balances technical precision with usability. You’ll work across disciplines—from engineering and design to support —to ensure a cohesive and delightful IaC delivery experience You Might Be a Fit If You Having hands-on experience delivering infrastructure with Terraform or OpenTofu at scale is essential. Understand the reality of state locking, orchestration, credentials, and approvals from a practitioner’s perspective. Have shipped products in technical domains: devtools, infrastructure, CI/CD, platform engineering. Speak fluently with engineers and love discovering real user jobs—not building to spec. Care about governance, composability, and safety—not just “shipping features.” What Success Looks Like OpenTofu and Terraform users default to Spacelift—not because we’re compatible, but because we’re the best. Common pain points in OpenTofu and Terraform workflows become non-issues for Spacelift users. The Foundations team moves faster because the product vision is clear and focused on real jobs. Our policy gates, context model, and run orchestration feel powerful, predictable, and humane. Why Spacelift? Innovative Culture: Join a team shaping cloud infrastructure management’s future. Growth Opportunities: Be a key player in driving Spacelift’s business and AWS partnership to new heights. Work-Life Balance: Flexible work environment, with remote-first options and competitive compensation packages. Collaborative Team: Work with passionate, talented people committed to driving success for our customers and partners.

"Principal Product Manager, Trilogy (Remote) - $200,000/year USD",Trilogy,Spain,"About the job You’ve had experience taking a software product from zero to launch, but you know that deep, thoughtful product work doesn’t end. You’re the kind of person who figures things out without a map, who goes deep on understanding the user, the problem, and the domain until a clear path emerges. You don’t want to manage a backlog or fill in a spec. You want ownership of a goal that matters and the space to pursue it with speed, insight, and focus. At Trilogy, we’re flipping the model. You’re not here to “own the roadmap”. You’re here to make one thing true: a real-world, measurable business outcome. You get one clear goal—something that should happen when users interact with the product—and your job is to make it happen. You’ll need to build deep domain insights using AI as your peer and feedback from users, codify them so that both your teammates and AI can act on it, and steer the product through fast, data-backed iterations until you hit the outcome. You’ll be joining a team that doesn’t celebrate busywork or beautiful process diagrams. You’ll be there to drive impact and make decisions rooted in user data, fast feedback loops, and sharp insight. If you’re sick of playing the PM game and want to actually change the game, please apply. We’re building what product management should have been all along. What You Will Be Doing Build BrainLifts: A structured, evolving body of expert insights that sharpens AI tools, guides decisions, and proves you understand the domain.

Building Domain Expertise: Acquire deep, structured understanding of a specific domain so that the team can make higher-quality decisions, create more tailored outputs, and communicate with authority.

Enthusiasm for using AI in your daily work (e.g., research, analysis, synthesis, or strategy). About Trilogy Hundreds of software businesses run on the Trilogy Business Platform. For three decades, Trilogy has been known for 3 things: Relentlessly seeking top talent, Innovating new technology, and incubating new businesses.
