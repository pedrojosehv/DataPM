We’re building the foundational layer - a sophisticated API-driven platform that can navigate and orchestrate billions of product permutations, from simple business cards to highly personalized apparel and retail packaging. This is not a standard Product Information Management system, nor is the foundation which it is built upon. The platform is a deeply technical data and rules engine, designed to handle extreme complexity in product data, customization rules, artwork automation, and manufacturing requirements. What You Will Do Define and execute the product strategy for the core platform layer, ensuring scalability, performance, and developer usability. Translate high-level customer needs into extensible platform features Collaborate deeply with engineering, architecture, and infrastructure teams to ensure robust, secure, and resilient design choices.

Passion for working on complex problems involving variable data, asynchronous workflows, and large-scale automation. Strong cross-functional skills — able to translate technical details for executive stakeholders, and vice versa.

Experience in the mass customization, print-on-demand, or configurable commerce space is a major plus. Hands-on familiarity with tools like Postman, Swagger/OpenAPI, SQL, and modern cloud services (AWS, GCP, etc.).

We have a Remote-First operating model and culture, with team members in over 15 countries and 30 US states, offering autonomy and the flexibility to work from home.
